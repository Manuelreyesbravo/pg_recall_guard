# This used to point at the repo root, which has no such subdirectory, so the
# element matched nothing and every suite silently ran against the copy
# installed in SHAREDIR -- whatever version was last `make install`ed, not the
# code in this repo. Found when 0.5.0 was written and the test still reported
# 0.4.1's behaviour. Links, not copies, so an edit is seen without re-init; made
# again on start so a new upgrade script is picked up too.
